# Board-Game-Application

This is a C++ implementation of a board game application that allows users to play the nine almonds game, the magic square game, and reversi.

This program initializes a board relevant to the game selected, asks a user to select a piece as well as a new destination for that piece, as long as the move is valid. The program gives appropriate error messages if the user inputs a move that goes against the rules of the game, or if the user inputs an invalid command. The program ends when there is either a stalemate, meaning there are no more valid moves available, or if a victory is reached for the specific game being played.
